# A-raylib-Game
A creating a raylib game and i liked c++ so much ( neovim btw )

So that Game Will be A platformer i don't really know about the ideas but i was thinking of:

1. ðŸ‘º Makeing enemys
2. ðŸ”« Make the player shooting
3. ðŸ‘¿ A boss fight


It's A Top Down Game That will be created of Simple Shapes

The Player Can Dash

I was thinking Of a Platformer But it Look HARD!
